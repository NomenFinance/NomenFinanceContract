The Nomen Finance Mission:
<p>Nomen Finance is not a meme coin! Nomen comes from the word Nomenclature, which is a term used in chemistry. 
Nomenclature is "a set of rules to generate systematic names for chemical compounds". This leads to the next point which is the purpose of Nomen Finance.</p>

<p>The goal of Nomen Finance is to implement the concepts of blockchain transactions into scientific research and engineering. 
 It's core aim is for the Nomen Finance token to be used among healthcare practitioners as well as scientific researchers. 
 Nomen Finance wants to speed up the process between researchers and healthcare providers by getting rid of the countless protocols and immense trials needed to be successful. 
 For example, the Nomen Finance team wants to provide a way for a patent of a chemical to be approved through the blockchain. </p>
