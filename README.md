Code for Nomen Finance Contract

Tokenomics:

- The Nomen ($NMN) Token was created for rewarding holding while preventing price crashes with a safety net feature. Here’s how it works: 50% of the token’s total supply will be sent to a burn address, also referred to as the “Friendly Whale”, where funds are inaccessible. This means the “Friendly Whale” (dead address) will ensure that the price will never dip below a certain point. This point will increase upon every transaction. 

- 3% tax is collected and distributed to holders for holding

- 10% tax is collected when sold and is distributed to holders
