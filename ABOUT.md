ABOUT NOMEN FINANCE

Nomen Finance Mission:
- Nomen Finance is not a meme coin! Nomen comes from the word Nomenclature, which is a term used in chemistry. Nomenclature is "a set of rules to generate systematic names for chemical compounds". This leads to the next point which is the purpose of Nomen Finance.

- The goal of Nomen Finance is to implement the concepts of blockchain transactions into scientific research and engineering. It's core aim is for the Nomen Finance token to be used among healthcare practitioners as well as scientific researchers. Nomen Finance wants to speed up the process between researchers and healthcare providers by getting rid of the countless protocols and immense trials needed to be successful. For example, the Nomen Finance team wants to provide a way for a patent of a chemical to be approved through the blockchain.

Tokenomics:

- The Nomen ($NMN) Token was created for rewarding holding while preventing price crashes with a safety net feature. Here’s how it works: 50% of the token’s total supply will be sent to a burn address, also referred to as the “Friendly Whale”, where funds are inaccessible. This means the “Friendly Whale” (dead address) will ensure that the price will never dip below a certain point. This point will increase upon every transaction. 

- 3% tax is collected and distributed to holders for holding

- 10% tax is collected when sold and is distributed to holders
